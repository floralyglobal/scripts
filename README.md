# This is a collection of linux scripts and ansible scripts from my Cyber Class.
# Most of the scrupts are used to configure cloud servers with different docker containers
# The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump bokx and a server running ELK  stack container.
